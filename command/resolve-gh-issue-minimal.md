Let's try to come up with a plan for how to implement a resolution for this Github issue in the sst/opencode repository: 

gh issue view $1;

Take note of any coments on the issue, the discussion may include valuable insights on how to best resolve the issue:

gh issue view $1 --comments;

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to any comments from your user, ariane-emory, she often has good ideas!

Make the minimal change required to solve the issue. Do not make any unnecessary changes unrelated to the changes that are required to resolve the isue.

!`opencode expand ~/.config/opencode/md/resolve-gh-issue--epilogue.md $ARGUMENTS`
