description: VERSION reminder.

When I run `bun dev`, i'ts showing 'local' in the bottom right corner instead of the correct hardcoded version string based on the integration branch's name.

The VERSION constant MUST a simple hard-coded string literal. It MUST NOT be dynamically computed in any circumstance.
