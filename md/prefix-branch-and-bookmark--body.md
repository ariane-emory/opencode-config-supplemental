Set the title of the current session by prefixing the name of the branch at its beginning. 

So, for example, if the branch is currently named "foo bar baz" and the current branch is named "feat/quux", its new title should be "feat/quux foo bar baz".

In addition, bookmark the current session. 

You can use the `get_current_session_title`, `set_current_session_title` and `bookmak_current_session` tools to do this.
