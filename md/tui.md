Recent changes in dev (that we are now in sync with) mean that all the settings in the `tui` group in the `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc` file are now beaing being migrated into a new `tui.json` file, and this is complicating things for this feature branch, since after the settings that it adds get migrated to the `tui.json` file they are then not visible in the expected location to the feature.

To avoid this problem, lets move the `tui.$1` setting to `experimental.$1`. Find all the usages/references to this setting and come up with a plan to move it to the `experimental` group.
